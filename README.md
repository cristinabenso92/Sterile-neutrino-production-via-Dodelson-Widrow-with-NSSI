### Goal
We want to explore what is the effect of neutrino non-standard self-interactions (NSSI) on the production of sterile neutrino dark matter through oscillation and collisions in the early universe. Non-standard interactions involving also sterile neutrinos and charged leptons are left to future work.

### Description
We provide a Mathematica implementation of the Boltzmann equation for the standard Dodelson-Widrow production mechanism. 
With this code it is possible to obtain the distribtution function and the abundance of sterile neutrino dark matter. 
We implement the contributions coming from diagonal (affecting only electron neutrinos and antineutrinos) NSSI to the standard Boltzmann equation: modifications of the interaction rate and the thermal potential. 
Notice that, due to the assumption of Majorana neutrinos, the only non-zero contributions come from scalar, pseudoscalar and axial vector NSSI.
We provide the code to solve the Boltzmann equation including the non standard contribution. The results are represented in the typical plots representing the parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter. 
We investigate the impact of NSSI on the free streaming length of sterile neutrinos (impact on structures formation) using the obtained modified distribution functions.
